Dataset1.csv is the dataset used in this implementation of neural network
Dataset.csv has 839,000 entries it will take more than 30 mins to train and test the neural network with this dataset
Dataset2.csv is the dataset used in experimentation.

Run the NeuralNetwork.py file and the results will be generated in the output.
These results I have shown in the documentation and expalined the reasons for not using Dataset.csv and Dataset2.csv

There are no user guides as no GUI is involved just run the python file to for implementation

Other information is written in the documentation of this project

You can tinker with the code by changing the number of neurons and epochs and even the dataset file 
and the output will be generated accordingly

The DatabaseGenerator.py was used to create the database which mirrors the data collected from the ES system
There is no need to change anything about this file.

Please install the modules like Matpltlib, Keras and pandas to run this application
Because I am using Conda python interpreter all these were not installed in the system interpreter
